          In my early years of high school, I had the opportunity to become involved in a school program that created analytic
          maps by using drone technology to take overlapping images and software to automatically stitch them together.
          After failed attempts to manually overlap the pictures during one project, it became apparent that there was
          a gaping hole in the process of making a map. ArcGIS specialists are capable of stitching and overlapping pictures
          “by hand” using specialized software, but anyone who isn’t an expert and doesn’t have access to this software has
          to eyeball the overlap. There is software like Esri’s Drone2Map extension which automatically stitches images
          together, and apps like Letchi that plan a flight path, but at the time when the need for this tool became
          apparent to me, there was little to actually determine the <strong><em>necessary
          relative positioning</em></strong> between images so that they may be stitched together. Eyeballed guessing becomes horribly
          inefficient very quickly as the complexity of a map increases. Flight Plan Computation is an attempt to fill this
          hole, and is the result of a series of unprecedented developments.

          Frustrated by my failure on the previously mentioned project, I set out to discover or create a systematic and
          easily repeatable method to solve this problem. I first realized that I could use simple trigonometry to
          determine the exact positioning of images relative to each other needed to achieve the required overlap.
          After working through this process, I realized that code could be written to do the computational component
          of the process, so I wrote a computer program. At this point, I had a powerful tool. With the program doing
          the math, I could work within the parameters quicky, and do in a matter of minutes what might have taken days.
          However, there was an issue. It was somewhat ironic that I was the only one who had access to the tool, while also
          being the only one that could work through the process without the assistance of the tool. I decided that
          the next phase was to make my program widely accessible. I built a website, and implemented the code inside of
          it in the way that made the most sense to me. My intention was to provide a solution to the problem that any
          non-specialist faces when making a map. I am optimistic about the results.
