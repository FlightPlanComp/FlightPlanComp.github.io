          <h3 class="usageHeader">General Usage</h3>
          <ul class="usageList">
            <li>The large rectangle represents the ground covered by an image taken at the given height.</li>
            <li>The visual component is not to scale.</li>
            <li>FPC was built to work alongside Letchi, an app that allows the user to create automated flight plans,
              and Esri’s Drone2Map extension, which automatically stitches images that have been precisely positioned
              relative to each other. FPC does not take in parameters and then map out a complete flight plan. It was
              built with people in mind who are familiar with what is involved in making a map and want the degree of
              flexibility that FPC offers.</li>
              <li>FPC was not intended to be used on tiny screens. </li>

          <h3 class="usageHeader">Inputs</h3>
          <ul class="usageList">
             <li>To use FPC, type the parameters into their respective text boxes in the variables section.
              Press compute, and output values will be displayed on the visual. </li>
              <li>Every input is entered as a unitless quantity.</li>
             <li>Enter the FOV (field of view) of the camera (in degrees). If the FOV is 66 degrees, enter 66.</li>
             <li>Enter the drone height, which is displayed live on most drone
              compatible apps, and can be customized in a flight plan on the Letchi app.</li>
             <li>Enter the overlap as a percentage. Don’t enter the percent symbol(%), the program knows that a
               percentage is being inputted. Overlap parameters can be found in the software that you are using to stitch images.</li>
             <li>Take the desired image aspect ratio (image height to width ratio), and enter the individual parts of the ratio into their respective boxes.</li>
             <li>A unit is not required for the computation. You can even enter non-length units -- Joules(J),
               femtoseconds(fs), apples(apples) -- if you are feeling adventurous. </li>
          </ul>

        <section class="usageSect">
          <h3 class="usageHeader">Outputs</h3>
          <ul class="usageList">
              <li>The X and Y coverage represents the side lengths of the rectangle of ground covered by an
              image taken at the inputted height.</li>
              <li>The X and Y overlap represents the side-to-side/top-and-bottom overlap distance needed based on the inputted parameters.</li>
              <li>The X and Y excess represents the difference between the side lengths of the coverage rectangle
                and the respective side lengths of the overlap rectangle. This is the amount of the image that isn’t required
                to overlap with a consecutive image. </li>
